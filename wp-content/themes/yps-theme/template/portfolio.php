            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>Direct Specs is a chain of high street opticians with practices based in Wolverhampton and surrounding counties in the Midlands. The previous website was built on a proprietary system with serious limitations in design and functionality. There was no option to personalise the glasses order and the admin had to adopt significant workarounds to do simple day to day tasks. </p>
            <p>The Direct Specs team approached Yellow Pixel on the basis of the expertise and domain knowledge that the Yellow Pixel has acquired in the opticians sector. They wanted to improve the overall customer experience and also offer features which will allow customers to personalise their glasses according to their prescriptions before purchasing them. Yellow Pixel team was up for the challenge!</p>

          <h6>Migrate the optician website from a proprietary ecommerce platform.</h6>
          <p>Direct Specs team was looking to create a modern online opticians website which would expand their high street business in the online ecommerce sector. The choice of ecommerce platform was important to ensure Direct Specs staff could manage the website independently.</p> 
          <p>The very capable team at Direct Specs had created a workflow of customer journey with a list of desired features which included the ability to enter and save prescriptions, recommend lenses on the basis of prescription, upsell with coatings, business logic to prevent data entry issues and more. </p>
          <p>The opticians wanted to work with an ecommerce agency that is comfortable with the optics sector and can provide solutions to the problems they were facing. They also wanted someone to guide them with their ecommerce strategy and also provide them with complete services as they did not have any technical staff on-board.</p>

          <h2>Personalising The Glasses</h2>
          <h6>Customised business process to personalise prescription glasses.</h6>
          <p>Yellow Pixel worked with the Direct Specs team to come up with a bespoke user flow. The workflow took into account the supported vision types, the ability to enter, save and upload prescription, variety of lenses, tints and coatings offered by Direct Specs and the business rules which allowed correct data entry and also made lens recommendations to customers on the basis of their prescriptions.</p>

          <p>We hired Yellow Pixel for our new website, for which we had a tight budget and needed a level of custom coding for the checkout process. After a number of conversations with Yellow Pixel team to plan it out, we decided to go ahead with the project. Throughout, Yellow Pixel have been helpful and competent – completing the project in good time and often going above and beyond. We would recommend them to anybody looking for a new website.</p>

            <p>Yellow Pixel were selected to develop the ecommerce website for opticians. The experience and knowledge that Yellow Pixel has in the area of optics matched by the technology solutions was convincing enough for Direct Specs to put their trust behind Yellow Pixel’s team. WordPress with WooCommerce platform was selected for the project as it fulfilled the technology requirements especially the comfort Direct Specs team had in using and working with WordPress.</p>
            <p> Setting up ecommerce for opticians requires comprehensive domain knowledge and experience in providing technology solutions. Together with Direct Specs, we have setup a road map of improvements and enhancements which will continue to support the high street chain. We wish Direct Specs the very best of success!</p>

          <p>A smooth customer journey was really important to Direct Specs from the moment the customer lands on the website to the point where they checkout with their favourite pair of glasses.</p>
          <p>Product filtering, navigation and product personalisation process was designed in a way that reduces the support calls and customers are able to glide through the website with ease. They see tooltips to help them in making the right choices, they have to upload their prescription or they cannot proceed forward, they have to select the right lenses and all through the process, they can see the overall order amount as they continue through this process of personalising their glasses.</p>

            <p>Building the solution on WordPress using a WooCommerce plugin has improved productivity for Direct Specs team because of their previous familiarity and experience with WordPress platform.</p>
